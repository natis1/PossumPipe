# PossumPipe

PossumPipe is a Youtube Client for Linux Smartphones.

We plan to package for both GTK and Qt on a variety of popular Linux Distributions, starting with Arch Linux.
The Project is still in very very early development, don't expect a package until June.

We're looking for an UI/UX Designer to join the Project, so please reach out if you're familiar with that.
